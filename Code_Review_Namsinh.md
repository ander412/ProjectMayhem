Project name: Project Mayhem
Programmers: Grayson Berman, Bailey Anderson, and Varsenik Aslanyan
Code Reviewer: Monique Namsinh

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 4 based on the following criteria:

1 I was not able to compile the program due to insufficient information in the README.md file.

2 At least one of the programs has syntax errors and does not compile

3 The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

4 The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results. Specifically: When I compile and run the server along with two clients, the welcome message is displayed after the first connection is made. There is no indication of whether the second client connection is made.  After the server sends the "Beginning Game" message, there are no prompts on how to start the game.  The README.md does not contain specific instructions on how to play the game.

5 The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not perform according to the documentation or does not comply with Chapman Coding Standards. Specifically:

6 The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented, following the Chapman Coding Standards.

Suggestions for improving the code (for extra credit!):
- Adding specific instructions to the README.md on how to run all the files correctly in order to play the game.
- Running checkstyle and fixing styling errors with brackets.
