Project name: Project Mayhem
Programmers: Grayson Berman, Bailey Anderson, and Varsenik Aslanyan
Code Reviewer: Ben Wasserman

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 4 based on the following criteria:

1  I was not able to compile the program due to insufficient information in the README.md file.

2  At least one of the programs has syntax errors and does not compile

3  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

4  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically: When I compile and run the server and the clients, the first client is returned the message, 'Welcome to Project Mayhem. You are the first to connect. Waiting for other player to connect' multiple times. After that, there aren't any prompts on how to begin the game.

5  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not perform according to the documentation or does not comply with Chapman Coding Standards.
Specifically:

6  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented, following the Chapman Coding Standards.

Suggestions for improving the code (for extra credit!):

1. Improvements could be made on styling so that it doesn't flag checkstyle errors. One that I noticed show up frequently was to change open brackets so they aren't on their own line.
2. The print statements in the ClientHandler only go to the server, so these need to be sent back to the clients and displayed accordingly.
