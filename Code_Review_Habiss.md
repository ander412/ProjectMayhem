Project name: Project Mayhem
Programmers: Grayson Berman, Bailey Anderson, and Varsenik Aslanyan
Code Reviewer: Rabah Habiss

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 4 based on the following criteria:

4  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:
The README.md is missing instructions on how to run the application, so I assumed I would need to start up the server along with two different clients to run the game. Compiling and running the said files did not produce any errors and both the clients and the server were showing correct information whenever a client connected to the server. However, there seems to be an issue with starting the game. When both clients are connected the server shows the message "Beginning Game" and nothing happens after that.
I noticed there is a GUI folder but I didn't know how to compile or run the GUI version.

Suggestions for improving the code (for extra credit!):
This is a general comment and not related to improving the code: Add instructions to the README.md on how to setup and play the game.
