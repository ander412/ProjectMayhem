Project name: Project Mayhem 


Programmers: Grayson Berman, Bailey Anderson, and Varsenik Aslanyan 


Code Reviewer: Riccardo Angiolini


On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 4 based on the following criteria:


1 I was not able to compile the program due to insufficient information in the README.md file.


2 At least one of the programs has syntax errors and does not compile


3 The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors


4 The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results. 
Comments: Overall there are no major “code errors” or “bugs” when analyzing or running the code. Having said this, after I ran and compiled the server and the clients, the first client just returns a message stating, “Welcome to Project Mayhem. You are the first to connect. Waiting for other player to connect” many times. Following this, there aren't any prompts within the game itself on how to begin, and furthermore none were provided in the README file either. There were also a couple of checkstyle concerns that can be an easy fix if someone went through them. Lastly, I noticed a GUI folder in the repo but I did not understand its purpose…does this game have a GUI side to it as well? Again, wish I had instructions on how this project worked more specifically as it really would have helped.


5 The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not perform according to the documentation or does not comply with Chapman Coding Standards. Specifically:


6 The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented, following the Chapman Coding Standards.


Suggestions for improving the code (for extra credit!):


	1.	Fix the couple of styling “warnings” when running checkstyle, most importantly the brackets one which seemed like the most common.
  
  
	2.	The print statements within the ClientHandler only show up on the server side, make sure they appear on the clients end as well.
  
  
	3.	Please add instructions in your README on your project as a whole, to facilitate the execution and review of future graders/reviewers when need be.
